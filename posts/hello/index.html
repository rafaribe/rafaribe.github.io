    <h1 id="hello-world">Hello World</h1>
<p>Hello, world! Isn&rsquo;t this the first program we all write when trying out a new programming language? I guess this makes it a cool title for this blog post as well.
This is my first post on my blog and as such I would like to introduce myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Rafael Ribeiro, I&rsquo;m 28 years old and I like to work with computers.
I was born and raised in a small village in the Portuguese interior but since early I liked to play around with computers. At first to play games and at about 15 years of age, I found myself choosing a course for my 10th-year Secondary School which vaguely translates to the &ldquo;Informatic Technological Course&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In there I had the first contact with programming, my first editor was Turbo Pascal? Remember that? It looked like this:</p>
<p><img src="/img/hello-world/turbo-pascal-image.png" alt="Turbo Pascal"></p>
<p>Yeah, I know right? That&rsquo;s grandpa&rsquo;s code editor!</p>
<p>A few years have passed, we learned other programming languages, like C and PHP (this one sucks btw ðŸ˜›), messed around with databases, and so on and a few years after going to college and getting into Computer Science,
I liked pretty much everything about it except the Math classes, but looking in retrospect they have their place and they are really valuable.</p>
<p>Anyway, in college, I got contact with even more programming languages such as C++, C#, Visual Basic, Prolog, Lisp, to name a few, and also touched in other areas that I find interesting, such as networking and systems administration. I got into programming and started working for a company after finishing up my graduation and while taking a Master&rsquo;s Degree.</p>
<p>I worked for three years in a single project, mainly doing C#, SQL Server, and being your Jack-of-all-trades, do everything kind of guy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taken a new job since the beginning of the year and, by my choice, decided to embrace that inner sysadmin in me and leaned more towards a DevOps role in the company, dealing with cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines and also programming, I didn&rsquo;t stop programming.
It is an exciting thing for me. I&rsquo;ve started learning and utilizing some exciting technologies such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Docker</li>
<li>Kubernetes</li>
<li>Flux</li>
<li>Loki</li>
<li>Prometheus</li>
<li>Traefik</li>
<li>cdk8s</li>
<li>Java with Spring</li>
<li>Pulumi for Infrastructure provisioning</li>
<li>and many more&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>This also made me in love with cloud-native software.</p>
<p>One of the other things that I&rsquo;ve changed is my engagement with the community.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve attended some meetups and webinars like crazy the past few months, and they have proven to me to be such a valuable tool to learn new things, that I can&rsquo;t imagine how I went all these past years without them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an exciting time, and launching this new blog I hope to share a bit of my experience with the community, do some tutorials and maybe help someone in some way.</p>
<p>Stay tuned ! ðŸ˜Ž</p>
